# Diskless
Diskless is currently stable enough to use for simple projects, but be careful with it.

Diskless is a library for OpenComputers that lets you create virtual disks in memory. They work almost exactly like the real filesystem components, but are stored entirely in RAM.

It should be fairly accurate to the real filesystem components, but I can't guarantee 100% accuracy.
